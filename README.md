Fractal plotting methods : 

Polynomial methods : Halley, HouseHolder, Newton, for any polynomial (complex coefficients are allowed!)

Others : Burning Ship, Mandelbrot, ... did Julia but lost the file anyway it's similar to Mandelbrot's method

The Polynomial roots are found using the Laguerre method : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9thode_de_Laguerre

Awesome math library used for this project : https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/
